## Description
This is a new project where an external library is used
This project is able a first person shooter, with the goal of learning more about game engine
The rendering is going to be implemented manually. No existing lib will be used except the SDL 
for accessing the peripherics. This game engine will only rely on the CPU

## Integration
The SDL lib is required. Either build it from the github repo or download the binaries from the
release server. You should copy the headers in external/include and the binaries in external/Release
